# FIR Filter Design MATLAB simulation
 report of designing a FIR filter using MATLAB
 
 In this project, we are going to design anFIR filter for a noisy signal with a
signal-to-noise ratio of 40. First, we count the number of operations required for
filtering the signal, then we draw the signal and its fast Fourier transform, the
noise with the functionawgn ) to the signal. Then we design the filter. Finally, we
performdecimation .and design the filter again and report the results

All M-File's are available.
Please read the FIR Filter Design MATLAB simulation.pdf file for detailed instruction and resault reports.
